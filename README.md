Implementation of simple linear regression model on salary dataset
## Theory of Linear Regression
Linear Regression is usually the first machine learning algorithm that every data scientist comes across. It is a simple model but everyone needs to master it as it lays the foundation for other machine learning algorithms.It is a very powerful technique and can be used to understand the factors that influence profitability. It can be used to forecast sales in the coming months by analyzing the sales data for previous months. It can also be used to gain various insights about customer behaviour. By the end of the blog we will build a model which looks like the below picture i.e, determine a line which best fits the data.
